\section{Results}
\subsection{Mimicking human jaw motion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item human jaw motion from motion capture
    \item results of PCA on human jaw motion
    \item show graphs of human jaw motion vs robotic jaw motion
    \item show graphs of the force during chewing for human vs robot
\end{itemize}

\subsection{chewing force}
\begin{itemize}
    \item max force that can be applied by the robot (both vertical and shear)
\end{itemize}
