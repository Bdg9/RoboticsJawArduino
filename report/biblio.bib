abstract = {In this paper, we present a design of mastication robot for texture analysis of foods in similar environment of human masticatory process respect to the following two things: First, subminiature load cells were installed at each artificial tooth of the upper jaw in order to directly measure interaction forces between the each tooth and foods. Collecting the sensor signals on each tooth, we can see which of teeth dominantly interacts with foods and analyze different patterns of the interaction forces among the incisor, cuspid and molar teeth. Second, we developed linear actuators for human masticatory muscles, which size, acting force, and coordination of attachment match with human counterpart. By appropriately coordinating the linear actuators, the resultant jaw motion can replicate the human chewing motion; thus, it generates similar patterns of the interaction forces between human teeth and foods. Two experiments for realization of the chewing motion and analysis of interaction forces between each tooth and food samples were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed mastication robots.}

@article{BristolChewingRobot,
title = "Prototyping artificial jaws for the Bristol Dento-Munch Robo-Simulator; `A parallel robot to test dental components and materials",
abstract = "This paper presents the robot periphery for the robotic dental testing simulator based on a parallel robot (i.e. stewart platform) to simulate the wear of materials on dental components, such as individual teeth, crowns or a full set of teeth. Current chewing simulators move in only 1 or 2 degrees of freedom (DOF) and therefore lack accuracy. The Bristol simulator has been developed to replicate accurate human chewing patterns in 6-DOF. This paper describes the artificial jaws and compliance module of the robot. The jaws have been reverse engineered and represent a human-like mandible and maxilla with artificial teeth. Each clinically fabricated tooth consists of a crown and glass ceramic roots which are connected using resin cement. Correct occlusion of the artificial jaws assembly was assessed by a dental teaching simulator. A compliance module had to be built between the lower jaw and the robot platform to sustain the fluctuating forces that occur during normal chewing in the occlusal contact areas, where these high bite forces are major causes of dental component failure. A strain gauge force transducer has been integrated into the machined lower jaw, underneath the second molars, to measure axial biting forces applied to the posterior teeth.",

@article{ChewingRobotGums,
title = "Development of a Chewing Robot with Built-in Humanoid Jaws to Simulate Mastication to Quantify Robotic Agents Release from Chewing Gums Compared to Human Participants",
abstract = "Medicated chewing gum has been recognised as a new advanced drug delivery method, with a promising future. Its potential has not yet been fully exploited because currently there is no gold standard for testing the release of agents from chewing gum in vitro. This study presents a novel humanoid chewing robot capable of closely replicating the human chewing motion in a closed environment, incorporating artificial saliva and allowing measurement of xylitol release from the gum. The release of xylitol from commercially available chewing gum was quantified following both in vitro and in vivo mastication. The chewing robot demonstrated a similar release rate of xylitol as human participants. The greatest release of xylitol occurred during the first 5 minutes of chewing and after 20 minutes of chewing only a low amount of xylitol remained in the gum bolus, irrespective of the chewing method used. Saliva and artificial saliva solutions respectively were collected after 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes of continuous chewing and the amount of xylitol released from the chewing gum determined. Bioengineering has been implemented as the key engineering strategy to create an artificial oral environment that closely mimics that found in vivo. These results demonstrate the chewing robot with built-in humanoid jaws could provide opportunities for pharmaceutical companies to investigate and refine drug release from gum, with reduced patient exposure and reduced costs using this novel methodology.
