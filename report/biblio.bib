abstract = {The motion of the jaw during chewing may be used to help diagnose and assess disorders associated with the temporomandibular joints and muscles. In this paper we examine different co-ordinate frames which might be used in the analysis of motion capture data for chewing. While the jaw is often considered a hinge joint, allowing rotation about an axis, it also exhibits significant translational motion. We show that principal components extracted using a Cartesian co-ordinate frame explain at least as much, and in some cases more, of the motion as those extracted from cylindrical co-ordinates. We also show that these components can be used to extract the cyclic motion of the jaw during chewing.},

abstract = {The development of chewing is an essential motor skill that is continually refined throughout early childhood. From a motor control perspective, the advancement of textures is dependent upon the fit between a child's oral anatomic and motor system and food properties. The purpose of this exploratory study is to identify age-related changes in chewing motor coordination and control and to determine if these changes are associated with the differing structural properties of solid foods, as well as to explore the role of explanatory variables such as the emergence of teeth and bite force. The masticatory muscle coordination (i.e., coupling of synergistic and antagonistic muscle pairs) and control (i.e., speed, displacement, chewing rate, duration, and number of chews) of fifty children were assessed cross-sectionally at five ages: 9-, 12-, 18-, 24-, and 36-months using electromyography (EMG) and 3D optical motion capture while children ate three foods that had differing structural properties. The results of this study found that children made gains in their chewing motor control (decreased duration of chewing sequences and lateral jaw displacement) and coordination (improved jaw muscle coupling) throughout this period. The structural differences in foods also affected chewing performance at all ages. These preliminary findings suggest that some solid textures are better adapted for immature mandibular control than others and that the development of chewing is a protracted process that may be impacted by the emergence of teeth and changes to bite force.}

abstract = {Statement of Problem. Patients who have lost moderate posterior tooth support may also lose clenching force as a result of sensitivity to increased loading to the remaining teeth and possibly a loss of muscle strength, because clenching forces are limited to avoid stress to the remaining teeth. Few studies have correlated moderate posterior tooth loss with maximum clenching force. Purpose. The purpose of this pilot study was to test the hypothesis that moderate loss of posterior tooth support will have a significant effect on maximum clenching force. Material and Methods. The maximum clenching force of 44 adults, ages 28 to 76 (mean 46), with posterior tooth loss was compared with the maximum clenching force of a control group of 20 healthy full dentition adults, ages 18 to 55 (mean 30), by use of a bilateral strain-gauged transducer. The transducer consisted of 2 stainless steel plates separated by a steel sphere that balanced occlusal forces between right and left sides. Acrylic resin pads were fabricated for each patient to protect the cusps of the teeth. The overall accuracy was found to be within 2.3% of full scale over a range of 0 to 4000 N (0 to 900 lbs). The calibration reliability of the system was checked frequently by use of a dead weight of 222 N (50 lbs). Clenching forces were supported by first and second molars and second premolars when possible. The instrumentation, methods, and operator were the same for both groups. A 2-tailed Student t test (α=0.01) and a pooled estimate of the mean were used to determine possible statistical significance. To test for possible correlations between clenching force and lost tooth support and between clenching force and age, a linear regression correlation coefficient R was calculated. Results. For the 44 subjects with posterior tooth loss, the mean clenching force was 462 N (104 lbs), with a range of 98 to 1031 N (22 to 232 lbs). This compares with a mean of 720 N (162 lbs) with a range of 244 to 1243 N (55 to 280 lbs) for the full-dentition subjects. A 2-tailed t test showed that the average difference of 258 N (58 lbs) between the 2 groups was significant (P≤.01). There was only a moderate negative association between clenching strength and loss of mandibular tooth support (R = −0.35). Clenching force was not well correlated with age as indicated by low R values (R = 0.21, missing tooth group and R = −0.03, full dentition group). Conclusion. Within the limitations of this study the maximum clenching force was less (P≤.01), by 258 N (58 lbs) on average, in subjects with moderate loss of posterior tooth support. Loss of maximum clenching force was associated with a modest negative correlation to the number of missing teeth in the mandibular arch (R = −0.35). The range of clenching force was surprisingly large for both the missing tooth (98 to 1031 N) and full dentition (244 to 1243 N) groups. (J Prosthet Dent 2002;88:498-502.)}

abstract = {Previous studies have paid little attention to either the development or sexual dimorphism of masticatory performance. The aim of this study was to measure and compare the masticatory performance of adults and children. Forty-seven healthy and normal individuals (15 adult men, 15 adult women, 15 young girls and 2 young boys) were selected, based on their occlusion, temporomandibular joint function, skeletal classification, and the state of their dentition. Masticatory performance was evaluated by the individual's ability to break down a standardized bolus. Cuttersil impression material was chewed for 20 strokes, spat out, dried, and passed through a series of seven sieves. The Rosin-Rammler equation was used to calculate the median particle size and broadness of particle distribution. Measurements of dentitional surface area, contact area, bite force, mandibular morphology, and body size were also taken as covariates. The results showed significant differences in masticatory performance among the three larger groups; men performed best, followed by women then girls. Multiple regression analyses showed that body size was the most important variable associated with differences in masticatory performance. Adjusting for weight eliminated the group differences. Body size, together with the occlusal contact area of the posterior teeth and the bite force, explained 60–72% of the variation in performance. Contact area, posterior ramus height, and bite force explained differences between men and women, but differences between adults and children remained.}
